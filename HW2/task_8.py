    Decrypter for the passwords will encrypt through the cipher map.
    A cipher grille is a 4Ã—4 square of paper with four windows
    cut out. Placing the grille on a paper sheet of the same size, the encoder
    writes down the first four symbols of his password inside the windows
    (see fig. below). After that, the encoder turns the grille 90 degrees
    clockwise. The symbols written earlier become hidden under the grille and
    clean paper appears inside the windows. The encoder then writes down the
    next four symbols of the password in the windows and turns the grille 90
    degrees again. Then, they write down the following four symbols and turns
    the grille once more. Lastly, they write down the final four symbols of
    the password.
